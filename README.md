# Welcome/Bienvenido

I was born in Colombia, where I finished my undergrad in biology.

Here at **WIS** I had the opportunity to participate in many labs during rotations. 

**For instance, here I want to show you a developing mushroom body from a Drosophila**

Currently, I joined [Peles lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/mcb/peles/) where I'm studying myelination in the brain
