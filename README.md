# Welcome/Bienvenido

I was born in Colombia, where I finished my undergrad in biology.

Here at [**WIS**](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/) I had the opportunity to participate in many labs during rotations. 

**For instance, here I want to show you a developing mushroom body from a Drosophila**

Currently, I joined [Peles lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/mcb/peles/) where I'm studying myelination in the brain and node of Ranvier formation. My Master's project involves the expression of a protein in the mouse brain. This protein has been classically associated to node of Ranvier formation in the PNS. However, little is known about this protein, which is significantly expressed in the human brain.
